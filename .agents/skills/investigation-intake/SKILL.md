# Investigation intake

Before commissioning an investigation, consult existing reports and established evidence.
Classify the deliverable:

- **Ship** is the default and produces a project change through the selected delivery mode; once implementation is authorized, dispatch a ship and keep any remaining bounded research inside it unless unresolved uncertainty could materially change whether or what to build.
- **Scout** produces knowledge in `data/<id>/report.md`, never a PR, and is appropriate for investigation, diagnosis, planning, reproduction, or audit work when the captain explicitly requests a separate knowledge or design deliverable or unresolved uncertainty could materially change whether or what to build.

If established evidence already answers an informational question, relay it without a design-only scout; when implementation intent is unclear, answer and ask one concise implementation question when useful rather than dispatching speculative design work.
Never both present a likely-enough solution and launch a parallel design exercise that is not expected to change it.
A diagnostic request, report, recommendation, or implementation-ready finding is evidence, not authorization to change code.
Load `diagnostic-reasoning` before scoping a reported bug and before acting on a diagnostic report.
